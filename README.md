# hello-world

HiÔºÅ

YUAN here. I am an MSc Biomedical engineering student from Imperial College and interested in Biomedical image processing.
I am now working on my final project about assessing the ability of diffusion tensor cardiac MRI to detect localised microstructural changes, which is challenging but very enjoyable.Thank supervisor Dr.Andrew for his guidance. 

It is a good time to start sharing code on Github from the second half of 2020.
Welcome your feedback and suggestions!
